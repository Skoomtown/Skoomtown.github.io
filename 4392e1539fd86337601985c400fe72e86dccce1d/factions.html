            <img src="../assets/images/flightcrew_promo.png" alt="Flight Crew Promo" class="update-image">
            <p>Your Flight Crew Needs You!</p>
            <p>We may not be the most glamorous faction, we cannot offer you the indolent lifestyle of a Royal or the spiritual fulfilment of a cult member, but what we have is our guts, our guile and our glorious ability to drink a whole bottle of whiskey without batting an eye!</p>
            <p>We in the Flight Crew know that, without our scrupulous attention and can-do attitude, this ship will never make it out of Earth's orbit. It is down to us and us alone to make sure this voyage successfully reaches its destination, regardless of the hurdles ahead.</p>
            <p>When all others succumb to panic in the face of an oncoming meteor shower it will be our talented pilots that carry us through the danger. When an infestation of space mosquitos takes up residence in the artificial gravity controls, it will be our fearless officers that strap on their sticky boots and eradicate the swarm with nothing but their wits and a nerf gun. When a drunken Royal spills their cup of Buckfastleigh Tonic Wine on the navigation panel and puts the ship on a collision course for a black hole, who else but our brilliant engineers will be able to strip out the caffeinated residue and return the control panel to perfect operation.</p>
            <p>We are the backbone of this ship, overworked and underappreciated but nevertheless the best of the best! If you feel like someone who's talents would suit the Flight Crew then sign up today!</p>

            <p>Wizards, warlocks, arcanists, and all other magically inclined disciplines! Thou art summoned to the Wizard's Council at Skoomtown 2024!</p>
            <p>We are the invaluable consultants & collaborators behind the Flight Crew's success, we are the most honoured advisors to the Royal Family & their loyal entourage, and we recently utilised our niche expertise to assist the Cult of Craig in preventing his divine wrath from dooming our upcoming journey. If you want to make a difference in every area of Skoomtown, what better place to be?</p>
            <p>"But Ben!" You say, "I have yet to begin my formal studies!". Worry not, my friends, all levels of magical talent will be accepted on the Council, for all perspectives are equal (except for Rambletoes the Disgraced Necromancer).</p>
            <p>Put on your thinking hats, don your finest spellcasting socks, and sign up to join the Wizards!</p>
